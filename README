ned editor
==========

simple editor written in Ada

This app is still under construction. Basic editing, loading and saving from and 
to files work. There still are major bugs, if the program crashes you could loose
your data.

build instructions
------------------

The alire build tool is required for building this application. https://alire.ada.dev/

`alr build` should suffice

usage
-----

ned supports basic editing commands found in emacs and vi. Because modes are avoided, 
vi-commands need to be prefixed with the [alt] key:

  [alt]-x                        Exit ned
  [alt]-w                        Save file

  [alt]-h | [C]-b | Arrow left   Cursor Left
  [alt]-j | [C]-n | Arrow down   Cursor Down
  [alt]-k | [C]-p | Arrow up     Cursor Up
  [alt]-l | [C]-f | Arrow right  Cursor Right
            [C]-e                Cursor to End of line
            [C]-a                Cursor to Start of line

                    Backspace    Backward delete
                    Delete       Forward delete
